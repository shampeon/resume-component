This site is authored in https://asciidoc.org[Asciidoc] and published using https://docs.antora.org[Antora].
Think of it as a small example of what I think makes a good documentation site.
For example, this content module is separate from the project that collects the content into a published site.
This module could, therefore, be reused in a different context.

== Structure of this site

This site consists of three different GitHub repositories: this content module ({url-project}[`resume-component`]), the overall site ({url-site-project}[`docs-site`]), and the custom Antora UI ({url-ui-project}[`antora-ui`]).

The `docs-site` repo has the https://gitlab.com/antora/demo/docs-site#user-content-antora-playbook[Antora playbook], `antora-playbook.yaml`, the configuration file that defines all the content sources and UI bundle location that is used to output the site.

The `antora-ui` repo is a fork of the default https://docs.antora.org/antora-ui-default/[Antora UI] with customizations to match the look and feel of https://www.techne.net[my existing site].

=== Continuous integration and continuous delivery

I'm using https://docs.github.com/en/actions[GitHub Actions] to provide continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) with this site. 

Changes to the `main` branch of `antora-ui` trigger a build of the UI bundle, and successful builds will result in a new `latest` tag and upload of the bundle ZIP file.

Changes to the `main` branch of `docs-site` trigger a build of the site, and if the build succeeds the output will be uploaded automatically to the published web site.
Changes to `docs-site` should be relatively rare, however, as `docs-site` only defines the configuration and sources for the site.
Changes to the content module repositories are more common, and should also trigger a new build of `docs-site` when the `main` branch of the content module changes either through commits or pull request merges.
It's harder to trigger these builds with GitHub Actions when you organize your repositories according to Antora's best practices, as the site repository is different than the content module repositories.

The solution is to configure a GitHub Action in the content module (`resume-component` in my case) where changes to the `main` branch of the content module repository trigger a build in the `docs-site` repository.
To accomplish this, I created and configured a GitHub personal access token, stored as a repository secret, to trigger the build in `docs-site`.

== Documentation formats

I've used a pretty wide variety of formats for authoring technical documentation, starting off with unstructured Framemaker and moving on through SGML, DITA, restructuredText, and more lately Markdown.

I tend to prefer semantic markup formats, and think https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYM[WYSIWYM] is the best paradigm for technical communicators.
But I also understand the appeal of simple, broadly implemented formats like Markdown, even if I don't actually love Markdown itself--I find it makes for a clumsy authoring experience.

Asciidoc is similar enough to Markdown to make it relatively easy to adapt for people new to the format, but is a complete authoring format on its own.
It has most of the same strengths as Markdown--simple, lightweight, and readable markup--without the drawbacks: punting the difficult use-cases to raw HTML or non-standard extensions, multiple dialects with varying levels of support, no domain-specific syntax for technical communication, and an overemphasis on making the output look a certain way.
Asciidoc is not semantic markup, but it was originally designed as a format for technical communicators.

If you look at the {url-project}[source of this site], you will see that I'm using the https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-recommended-practices/[Asciidoctor recommended best practices] for authoring in Asciidoc.
In particular, I'm using one sentence per line.
While it's not a common practice among tech writers, it really does make a lot of sense in a world where https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/[docs as code] is the dominant paradigm.
Reviewing changes in a documentation pull request would be so much easier if everyone adopted one sentence per line.

With all that being said, I've been doing this for a long time, and I can adapt and work in most environments.
Reasonable people disagree about formats, workflows, style.
This is just an example of what I prefer at this stage of my career, based on my experience writing docs in many different contexts over the last 25 years.
